# Java-To-Do-App
Build a To-Do list using Java Swing

This project is a simple To-Do List application developed using Java Swing, aimed at helping users manage daily tasks through a graphical interface. The application allows users to input tasks, add them to a list, and remove them when completed. The user interface is designed using standard Swing components like JFrame, JButton, JTextField, and JList, making the app lightweight and responsive. The layout is structured for clarity, with an input field at the top, a scrollable list in the center, and control buttons at the bottom.

The main goal of the project was to apply core Java GUI concepts in a real-world task management scenario. This application was developed as part of a learning exercise to strengthen understanding of event-driven programming, layout management, and component interaction in Java. It provides a practical foundation for beginners and can be further enhanced with features like task editing, file-based persistence, or checkbox support. The project reflects both individual learning and implementation skills using IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
